TAQLoRe - Transcript Annotation and Quantification using Long Reads

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at https://taqlore.readthedocs.io.

## Description

**TAQLoRE** is a Snakemake-based pipeline to identify and quantify gene isoforms from long read amplicon-based cDNA sequencing technologies (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, PacBio). **TAQLoRE** can be used to identify novel isoforms and improve existing annotations as well as quantify known transcript isoforms. It has been tested on Linux (CentOS 6).

Briefly, it uses LAST to align all reads to the transcriptome, then it discovers new exons by looking at insertions in alignments, it creates meta-gene with all known and novel exons, aligns all reads to it and generates a TMM-normalised read counts, together with expression heatmaps and PCA plots. It also identifies new splice sites by looking at perfectly aligned reads to the genome, and correcting all splice sites to the closest most abundant canonical ones.
